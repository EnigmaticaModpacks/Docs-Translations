When the box is already filled, it means that a translator has already translated the string.&#x20;

If the box is not filled, click on it and suggest your translation&#x20;

If you are not sure about a translation don't do it and let another translator translate it.&#x20;

If you believe a translation is incorrect or could be improved, you can fill the box with your own translation.
